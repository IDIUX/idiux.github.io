Product designer with a passion for people. User experience design, user interface design and interaction design expert.

Systems-thinker with an eye for detail. Pragmatic perfectionist. Engineer whisperer.

Designer of mobile apps since Nokias were cool. Designer of web apps since Netscape was king.

Equally comfortable pushing pixels, pencils or code.

Currently designing design tools at [Canva](https://www.canva.com "Product Designer at Canva").
